PageClass: signUpScreenPage.ts
LocatorsFile: signUpScreenLocators.json

Preconditions
• User has installed the app.  
• Device is connected to Wi-Fi or mobile data.  
• User is on the Login / Sign up Form screen.  
• No existing account is registered with the test email used in this scenario.  

Steps
1. Tap on the **Sign up** tab.  
2. Verify Email input field is visible.  
3. Verify Password input field is visible.  
4. Verify Confirm Password input field is visible.  
5. Tap inside the Email field and enter a valid new email address.  
6. Tap inside the Password field and enter a valid password (meeting required password rules, if any).  
7. Tap inside Confirm Password field and enter the same password.  
8. Verify the **SIGN UP** button becomes enabled after filling all fields.  
9. Tap the **SIGN UP** button.  
10. Wait for the loading/spinner (if any) to disappear.  
11. Verify the user is navigated to the appropriate post-registration screen (e.g., Welcome screen, Verification screen, or Home screen).  

Expected Results
• Sign up tab is selected and displayed correctly.  
• Email, Password, and Confirm Password fields are visible and accept input.  
• Password and Confirm Password fields mask user input.  
• SIGN UP button remains disabled until all fields contain valid data.  
• Password and Confirm Password must match — otherwise, an error should display (not part of this positive test).  
• Upon tapping SIGN UP with valid inputs, account creation is initiated.  
• User successfully reaches the next expected screen after registration.  
• No error message is displayed for valid sign-up details.
