appium
```

Or, to specify a host and port:
```bash
appium --address 127.0.0.1 --port 4723
```

---

## 🧪 Running Test Cases

To run a specific test case (example: `login.spec.ts`):

```bash
npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.ts --spec ./test/specs/login.spec.ts

npx wdio run ./wdio.parallel.conf.ts

npx wdio run wdio.parallel.conf.ts --specMap="emulator-5556:login.spec.ts emulator-5554:log.spec.ts"

```

---

## To generate test.spec.ts, page.ts and locators automatically using MCP
Edit testcase.txt file with the test case name and run below command then files will be generated and placed in folder locations as per framework folder structure

```npm
npm run generate:test -- testcase.txt
```
or
```bash
ts-node ./scripts/generate-test.ts testcase.txt
```

---

## 📊 Generating & Viewing Allure Reports

After test execution, generate and open the Allure report using:

```bash
allure generate allure-results --clean && allure open allure-report
```

---

## 🧾 Summary

This framework provides:

- ✅ WebdriverIO + Appium Integration  
- ✅ TypeScript for strongly-typed automation  
- ✅ Allure Reporting for detailed test insights  
- ✅ Support for both Android & iOS platforms  
- ✅ Integrated with MCP and OpenAI LLM

## 💡 Tips

- Use `appium-doctor` frequently to check setup health.
- Always clean old reports before generating new ones.
- You can configure parallel execution and cloud device testing (e.g., BrowserStack, SauceLabs).

##
- You can change golbal timeout in wdio.conf.ts at 'waitforTimeout: <milliseconds>'
